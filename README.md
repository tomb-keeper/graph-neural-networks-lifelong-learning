## Setup and Installation

Detailed instructions for setting up and installing the necessary dependencies are included. A Python virtual environment is recommended for this purpose. The main requirements are: pytorch, dgl, torch-geometric, numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and scikit-learn.

## Datasets

The datasets used in the paper are available [on zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3764770). They can be downloaded and used to test and reproduce the experiments in the paper.

## Experiments

Scripts for running a single experiment as well as scripts for visualizing and tabulating the results are provided. We also provide scripts for preprocessing the data for multiple experiments.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into any issues while using this repository, feel free to create an issue and we'll try to assist you best we can.
